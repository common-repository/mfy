One plug'n to rule them all...

Capture FB Messenger subscribers on your WordPress website with MFY's growth widgets. This plugin provides them all!

=== Why build a Facebook Messenger subscriber list? ===

If you aren't building a Facebook Messenger subscriber list in addition to your email list to grow your audience, you are missing out. 
Facebook Messenger is an amazing channel with 80% open rates and high engagement that beats email's 10% and even lower CTR. 

To be clear email works when it works but then again, why not do them both!?


=== MFY's Subscription Box Widget ===

With MFY Subscription Box now you can have the best of both worlds. Allow your visitors to signup as a subscriber via Facebook Messenger or via email. MFY Subscription Box is the only plugin you need to add multiple capture widgets or subscribe boxes on your website with a beautiful design and customizable call to action text that is proven to convert your visitors into subscribers.

=== MFY's Corner Widget ===

Do you want a chat widget for your WordPress website but don't have the bandwidth to chat with each and every visitor? We built the corner widget for you!

Here's how it works: A visitor is presented with two welcome messages from the corner widget. When they reply using any of the quick-reply answers, they become your 
Facebook Messenger subscriber. 

It comes with automatic user segmentation! A tag with their reply is also assigned to them so that you have some context on what is relevant to them. Then you can either add them to a FB Messenger campaign from MFY's dashboard OR initiate a one-on-one chat with them from your FB Page inbox.


=== Blazingly Fast ====

We have designed our plugins to load all widgets blazingly fast! We optimize for speed of loading by caching the super-optimized widget code in multiple edge servers across the world. It's also very easy to customize the widget (in real time!) via our MFY dashboard. You can even add custom CSS to control the look and feel of the plugin for a pixel-perfect match for your website branding.


=== Easy to Install ===

Installing MFY's WordPress plugin is the easiest way to grow your Facebook Messenger subscriber list and to nurture and keep your audience engaged via FB Messenger campaigns!

=== Free to get started! ===

The plugin is available for FREE and if you have a subscription to MFY app (free for the first 500 newly added subscribers), you can send Facebook Messenger campaigns to your subscriber list!
